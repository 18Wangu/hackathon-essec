## Introduction
This report provides an analysis of the security status of a website that uses the LinkedIn branding but may not be an official LinkedIn page. The purpose of this report is to highlight potential security risks and phishing indicators, providing actionable recommendations for improvement.

## Strengths
* The website links to LinkedIn's terms of use, privacy policy, and other policies.
* The website has a clear login option with multiple authentication methods (Google, Apple, email, phone number).

## Vulnerabilities
### Lack of HTTPS Connection
The website does not have an HTTPS connection, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering with data transmitted between the client and server.

### Insecure Login Options
* The login page has multiple options to log in with Google, Apple, email, or phone number. If these options are not properly implemented, they could be a potential security risk.
* There is no clear indication of what data the website collects or how it's used, raising concerns about user privacy.

### Phishing Indicators
* The website uses a mix of French and English language, which may indicate that it's not an official LinkedIn page.
* The website has a "Mot de passe oublié ?" (Forgot password) option, which could be used by attackers to reset passwords or gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
* The website has a "Rester connecté(e)" (Stay connected) option, which could be used to maintain user sessions and potentially enable unauthorized access to user accounts.

### Unclear Policies
* The links to LinkedIn's terms of use, privacy policy, and other policies are unclear if they are official documents or modified versions.
* The website has a "Politique de confidentialité" (Privacy policy) link, but it's unclear if this is an official document or modified version.

## Phishing Indicators
Based on the analysis, the following phishing indicators were identified:

* Use of non-official LinkedIn branding and language
* Presence of insecure login options
* Unclear policies and data collection practices

## Safety Evaluation
The website's security status is rated as "Critical" due to the presence of vulnerabilities and phishing indicators.

## Recommendations
To improve the website's security, we recommend:

1. Implement HTTPS connection to protect data transmitted between the client and server.
2. Secure login options by implementing proper authentication methods and ensuring that user data is collected and used in accordance with LinkedIn's policies.
3. Clarify policies and data collection practices by linking to official documents or modifying existing versions.
4. Improve website branding and language consistency to avoid confusion about its legitimacy.
5. Regularly update the website to ensure it uses the latest security patches and best practices.

By implementing these recommendations, the website can reduce its vulnerabilities and phishing indicators, providing a safer experience for users.
